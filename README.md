#Introduction 
#Key/value stores A key/value store is a simple kind of database where the main operations are:
# put KEY VALUE – stores the value under the given key 
# get KEY – returns the value stored under this key, 
#if any A simple key/value store is implemented in the files kv.c and kv.h in the ZIP file for this coursework. The API that you should use is in the header file; all other methods in the source file are implementation details. Note that this is a “toy” implementation – it is not particularly efficient, it does not save data to disk and there is a limited number of slots available. More importantly, the implementation is not thread-safe so you will need to manage synchronization yourself.
